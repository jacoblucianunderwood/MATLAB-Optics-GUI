# MATLAB-Optics-GUI
Originally a code made for showing simple-case ray diagrams for my Optics class as a bonus project, I wanted to create a GUI that showcases multiple lens shapes with various materials making the lens and different surroundings. Still currently a work in progress, but all the code and their iterations will be included.
