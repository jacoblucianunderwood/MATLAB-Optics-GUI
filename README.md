# MATLAB-Optics-GUI
Originally a code made for showing simple-case (thin lens and 2-D plano convex lens) ray diagrams for my Optics class as a bonus project, I wanted to create a GUI that showcases multiple lens shapes with various materials making the lens and different surroundings.

Currently there is work being made towards creating a GUI that incorporates the 2-D cases of the simple-case ray diagrams with these different materials and surroundings (originally just some form of glass and air, respectively). Initially the code was made to simulate the ray diagrams with the starting angle of incidence being zero, but now the challenge is updating the code to work with non-zero starting angles of incidence and how that affects the code.

Other potential features I would like to implement are different lens shapes, total internal reflection, more materials and surroundings, and, eventually if it isn't too ambitious, 3-D lens ray diagrams.
